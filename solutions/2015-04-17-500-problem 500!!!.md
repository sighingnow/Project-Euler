## 题目

The number of divisors of 120 is 16.

In fact 120 is the smallest number having 16 divisors.

Find the smallest number with 2<sup>500500</sup> divisors.

Give your answer modulo 500500507.

> So at this point, we think about doubling factor count and the ways we can do it. Out options are:
>   <1>. Multiply by a prime that we have never used so far.
>   <2>. Multiply by an existing prime k + 1 times, where k is the number of times it has been used.
> We repeat this 500500 times, using rule <1> and <2> (which can be generalized to one rule) and the result is the final answer.

| factor count | n                         |
|:------------:|---------------------------|
|  2           | 2                         |
|  4           | 2*3 <1>                   |
|  8           | 2*3*2*2 <2>               |
|  16          | 2*3*2*2*5 <1>             |
|  32          | 2*3*2*2*5*7 <1>           |
|  64          | 2*3*2*2*5*7*3*3 <2>       |
|  128         | 2*3*2*2*5*7*3*3*11 <1>    |

> For 16 factors the number works out to be 120 (just like the example!). For numbers shown in the questions, sieving the prime takes some time, I also found it helpful to use a binary heap for speeding up finding the next smallest factors.
